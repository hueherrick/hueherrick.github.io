    <p2>Hello! My name is Hue. Many people associate my name with the art term “hue” but it is actually pronounced like “Hawei.” I am currently a Senior at Boise State University where I am studying Marketing, Fine Arts, and Media Arts. After University. I hope to work in either social media marketing, or photography. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, and photographing the views that I see. I hope you like learning more about the equipment that I use, and the places that I have traveled to.

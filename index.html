        <h3><i>Yosemite</i></h3>
    <p><b>Yosemite is one of the most popular National Parks in the United States. It is well known for Ansel Adams Gallery, and it’s world famous valley view. Although there are some well known spots that everyone should visit. There are more locations that can only be found by those that look for it. Below are some of my favorite spots to not only sight see but also photograph. All of these locations are best photographed at golden hour, or blue hour.</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Glacier Point</li>
            <li> Sentinel Bridge</li>
            <li> Sentinel/Cooks Meadow Loop Boardwalk</li>
            <li> Yosemite Valley</li>

    <h3><i>Joshua Tree</i></h3>
    <p><b>Joshua Tree National Park may be my favorite National Park. It's desolate enough to feel immersed in nature but close enough to Los Angeles for it to be a day trip. Many people go there to rock climb, stargaze, and camp. It is the perfect location to take photos of the stars. There is little to no light since you are so far out in the wilderness. It has a very different vibe from many of the other national parks that makes it a lot more special, and more photogenic in my opinion.</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li> Arch Rock Nature Trail</li>
        <li> Hidden Valley</li>
        <li> Barker Dam</li>
        <li> Skull Rock</li>
        <li> Split Rock</li>

    <h3><i>Sawtooth Wilderness</i></h3>
    <p><b>The Sawtooths is such a great place to go if you are learning to backpack, and camp. It is such a great beginner trail, and it has a lot of locations that are great to stop at all along the way. If you are entering through Boise, you can stop by Stanley Idaho where there are tons of roadside views for those that don’t enjoy the outdoor scene as much. Below are some of my favorite stops to go and take photos.</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li> Alice Lake</li>
        <li> Petite Lake</li>
        <li>Redfish Lake</li>
        <li>Black Magic Canyon</li>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
